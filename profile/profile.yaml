summary: A motivated and detail-oriented individual who is passionate about using technology to optimize business processes and deliver value to stakeholders.
As a business analyst, I possess a unique combination of technical and business skills that enable me to bridge the gap between technical teams and business stakeholders. I have a Master's degree in information systems management and a Masters degree in development of Small and middle enterprises and have completed various training programs in data  analysis, Accounting and finance, project management, and software development methodologies.

I have a solid understanding of business processes, systems, and data, which allows me to gather requirements from stakeholders and translate them into technical specifications for developers. I possess strong analytical and problem-solving skills, which help me to identify areas for improvement and recommend solutions that are practical, feasible, and aligned with business objectives.

In addition, I have excellent communication skills, which enable me to effectively communicate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I have experience in managing projects, developing project plans, and ensuring successful delivery of solutions on time and within budget. I am a team player and have the ability to work collaboratively with cross-functional teams to achieve project goals.
