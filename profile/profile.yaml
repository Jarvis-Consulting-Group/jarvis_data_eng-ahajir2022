  - name: "PSQL Database management:"
    git_url: "sql"
    description: "As a part of a learning program, my work is to create a database and includes the creation of three tables: members, facilities, and bookings. The members table contains information about the members of a club, such as their memid (member ID), surname, firstname, address, zipcode, telephone, recommendedby, and joindate. The memid field is the primary key of this table, and the recommendedby field is a foreign key referencing another memid in the same table. This table was likely created to store information about the club's members and their relationships with one another. The facilities table contains information about the facilities that the club offers, such as their facid (facility ID), name, membercost, guestcost, initialoutlay, and monthlymaintenance. The facid field is the primary key of this table. This table was likely created to store information about the club's facilities and their associated costs. The bookings table contains information about bookings made by members for specific facilities, such as the bookid (booking ID), facid (facility ID), memid (member ID), starttime, and slots. The bookid field is the primary key of this table, and the facid and memid fields are foreign keys referencing the facid and memid fields in the facilities and members tables, respectively. This table was likely created to track bookings made by members for the club s facilities. Overall, these tables provide a framework for storing and organizing data related to a club s members, facilities, and bookings. The foreign key relationships between the tables allow for more complex queries and analysis of the data."
